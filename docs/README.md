# Introduction

### The problem

Traditional DAO governance systems don't work. In theory, voting is a rational process where voters select the best option for the group. In practice, that's not the case. Voting systems suffer many problems, including:

* **Low participation:** most people don't vote.
* **Uninformed voters**: most voters don't have a deep understanding of the decision at hand.
* **Whale and insider influence**: votes are often no more than rubber stamps than what's already been decided by insiders. In DAO votes, it's common to see a single wallet determine an entire vote.

### The solution: replace votes with markets

It's long been said that people buy with their head but vote with their heart. What if we could flip that on its head and use market processes to make decisions? That is the central idea behind **futarchy**_._

In futarchy, proposals don't go to votes: they get traded. When the market speculates that a proposal is good, it passes. When the market speculates that a proposal is bad, it fails.

MetaDAO is the first known futarchy. It provides governance infrastructure to create, manage, and participate in futarchies.
