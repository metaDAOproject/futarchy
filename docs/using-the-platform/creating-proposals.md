Business projects are how MetaDAO converts financial capital into revenue-generating products. Business direct actions operate over those products, tweaking parameters in the pursuit of customer satisfaction and profitability. Operations projects and direct actions support the business, ensuring that MetaDAO has the right people and resources to create new products and manage existing ones.

Each of these four proposal types has its own template. These are listed here:

- [Business project](proposal-templates/business-project.md)
- [Business direct action](proposal-templates/business-direct-action.md)
- [Operations project](proposal-templates/operations-project.md)
- [Operations direct action](proposal-templates/operations-direct-action.md)

Project proposals should generally be raised by entrepreneurs who are accountable to the DAO for their execution. Direct action proposals can be raised by anyone.

You can use any document app you want to create proposals.
