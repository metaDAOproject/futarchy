// sponsorProposal.ts, then launch it. Actions the DAO itself signs (like
// removeSpendingLimit) can't go through here, since a passed proposal is
// executed permissionlessly - enqueue those with enqueueTemplate.ts instead.
//
// If a run fails after "Squads transaction and proposal created!", don't
// re-run it as is - that creates a second squads proposal with the same
// instructions. Set RESUME_SQUADS_PROPOSAL to the logged squads proposal,
// keep the actions as they were (the script checks the proposal holds them),
